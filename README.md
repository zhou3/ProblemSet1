# ProblemSet1
Do **either** Problem 3 **or** Problem 4 from section 2.2. Try to follow the [data guide](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Gentzkow & Shapiro by automating the data processing steps, keeping files and code organized, and, of course, using Git/GitHub.

Feel free to use or modify the file structure in this repository, which in turn follows G&S's suggestions.

### Problem 3
_Either_ replicate Tables 1 and 2 from DGR (2011) using the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances, _or_ update their tables 1 and 2 using the more recent wave of the survey from 2013. Follow the methodology as described in their text. Plot the Lorenz curves for earnings, income and wealth.

### Problem 4
Replicate a part of Table 27 from DGR using the PSID between 2001 and 2007 by constructing the transition matrix for _either_ earnings _or_ income _or_ wealth. For the outcome variable you picked, plot the Lorenz curves for 2001 and 2007 in one graph, and compute the Gini for those years.
